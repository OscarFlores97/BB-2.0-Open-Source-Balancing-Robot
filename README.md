# BB-2.0-Open-Source-Balancing-Robot
Hello World! This is the official page of BB 2.0. I will provide all the files needed on this page. It’s not my project it’s OUR project. My goal is to create the base framework so anyone can build and improve or add to the base model to meet their needs. If you have any code that you would link to share, you can share it on reddit so we can discuss the codes. Thanks again!
